    \begin{block}{}
    Sphere of Influence (SOI) is the region around a body in which the gravitational pull from the body is larger
    than any other
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Earth is in the SOI of our sun
        \item The moon is also influenced by the gravity of the sun, but it's close enough to earth to makes its
            influence higher. So the moon is within the SOI of earth
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[t]{Intercept}
    \begin{block}{}
        When we are within the SOI of the target planet we need to slow down to be captured by the planet
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Burn retrograde to slow down until you fall into an highly elliptical orbit
            \item We want to circularize our orbit
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[t]{Intercept}
    \begin{block}{Aerobreaking}
        Instead of having to circularize your orbit (which is expensive) we can make use of the body's atmosphere to
        slow down
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Drop orbit just inside of the atmosphere
            \item Not too deep because you can burn up, not too shallow because it would take a very long time
            \item Wait a couple of orbits: you get closer every orbit because atmospheric drag slows you down
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
